# schedulingAlgorithms
Repository contains exercises which were algorithms learned on the subject: Scheduling Algorithms.
Every program as input gets a set of informations mostly given by the formula:
```
m, n
p_n_1 w_n_1
p_n_2 w_n_2
...
p_n w_n
```
The output depends on what we wanted to achieve with the algorithm.
